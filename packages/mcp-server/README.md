# @opengsd/mcp-server

MCP server exposing GSD orchestration tools for Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible clients.

Start GSD auto-mode sessions, poll progress, resolve blockers, and retrieve results — all through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

This package exposes three tool surfaces:

- session/read tools for starting and inspecting GSD sessions
- MCP-native interactive tools for structured user input
- headless-safe workflow tools for planning, completion, validation, reassessment, metadata persistence, and journal reads

## Installation

```bash
npm install @opengsd/mcp-server
```

Or with the monorepo workspace:

```bash
# Already available as a workspace package
npx gsd-mcp-server
```

## Tools

### Workflow tools

The workflow MCP surface includes:

- `gsd_decision_save`
- `gsd_requirement_update`
- `gsd_requirement_save`
- `gsd_milestone_generate_id`
- `gsd_plan_milestone`
- `gsd_plan_slice`
- `gsd_plan_task`
- `gsd_replan_slice`
- `gsd_replan_task`
- `gsd_rework_brief_save`
- `gsd_slice_complete`
- `gsd_skip_slice`
- `gsd_complete_milestone`
- `gsd_validate_milestone`
- `gsd_reassess_roadmap`
- `gsd_save_gate_result`
- `gsd_summary_save`
- `gsd_task_complete`
- `gsd_task_reopen`
- `gsd_task_recovery_resume`
- `gsd_slice_reopen`
- `gsd_milestone_reopen`
- `gsd_milestone_status`
- `gsd_checkpoint_db`
- `gsd_journal_query`
- `gsd_exec`
- `gsd_exec_search`
- `gsd_resume`
- `gsd_capture_thought`
- `gsd_memory_query`
- `gsd_memory_graph`

By default, the packaged MCP server advertises only the canonical workflow tool names above. Legacy aliases are compatibility names and are not included in `tools/list` unless `GSD_MCP_ADVERTISE_ALIASES=1` is set. Prefer moving clients and prompts to canonical names before enabling aliases, because aliases duplicate schemas in the model-facing tool surface.

These tools use the same GSD workflow handlers as the native in-process tool path wherever a shared handler exists.

Durable workflow mutations are atomic and replay-safe where they cross the canonical lifecycle boundary. Planning mutations (`gsd_plan_milestone`, `gsd_plan_slice`, `gsd_plan_task`, `gsd_replan_slice`, `gsd_replan_task`, and `gsd_reassess_roadmap`), task execution completion (`gsd_task_complete` / `gsd_complete_task`), and repaired-abort resumption (`gsd_task_recovery_resume`) prefer a nonblank private `_meta["io.opengsd/idempotency-key"]` value. A retry must resend the same value across requests and server processes. Claude Code clients may instead rely on the private `_meta["claudecode/toolUseId"]` value that Claude Code preserves across its MCP session-recovery retry; the server places that value in a reserved transport namespace. An explicit OpenGSD key takes precedence, and a malformed explicit key fails closed instead of falling back. Requests without either replay-stable identity fail before mutation. This metadata is not a tool parameter and does not change the public tool schema or response. Canonical names and compatibility aliases resolve to the same operation identity.

`gsd_task_recovery_resume` is a control-plane repair command, not an ordinary dispatched-unit tool. It requires the exact current abort `recoveryActionId`, a plain-language `repairSummary`, and non-empty structured `evidence`. It appends an immutable repair checkpoint and authorizes one lineage-linked Task Attempt; it does not delete the abort, reset its budget, mark the Task skipped, or authorize later Attempts.

**Opt-in aliases (kept for backwards compatibility — prefer the canonical name above):** `gsd_save_decision`, `gsd_update_requirement`, `gsd_save_requirement`, `gsd_save_summary`, `gsd_generate_milestone_id`, `gsd_milestone_plan`, `gsd_slice_plan`, `gsd_task_plan`, `gsd_slice_replan`, `gsd_complete_task`, `gsd_complete_slice`, `gsd_milestone_validate`, `gsd_milestone_complete`, `gsd_roadmap_reassess`, `gsd_reopen_task`, `gsd_reopen_slice`, `gsd_reopen_milestone`.

`gsd_decision_save` persists new decisions to the ADR-013 memory store, not to the legacy `decisions` table. If alias advertising is enabled, `gsd_save_decision` delegates to the same behavior. The assigned `D###` ID is recorded in `memories.structured_fields.sourceDecisionId`, and `.gsd/DECISIONS.md` is refreshed as a projection from memory-backed decisions. The legacy table may still be read by compatibility and inspection paths during the cutover window, but it is no longer a write target.

`gsd_summary_save` computes artifact paths from the supplied IDs. `milestone_id` is required for milestone-, slice-, and task-scoped artifact types (`SUMMARY`, `RESEARCH`, `CONTEXT`, `ASSESSMENT`, `CONTEXT-DRAFT`) and should be omitted only for root-level `PROJECT`, `PROJECT-DRAFT`, `REQUIREMENTS`, and `REQUIREMENTS-DRAFT` artifacts. The `content` field has a schema `maxLength` of 50,000 characters per save; callers that produce larger artifacts should save incrementally by writing a substantive draft, then re-save the enriched artifact as more detail is available. For final `REQUIREMENTS` saves, the tool renders content from active database requirement rows; callers must create those rows with `gsd_requirement_save` first.

`gsd_replan_task` updates one existing pending task's planning contract after rework without replacing sibling tasks. `projectDir` is optional; when omitted, the server uses its current project or worktree root. Required parameters are `milestoneId`, `sliceId`, `taskId`, `title`, `description`, `estimate`, `files`, `verify`, `inputs`, and `expectedOutput`; `reworkBriefRef` is optional and records the brief that triggered the update. The tool rejects missing tasks and legacy-closed or canonically completed/cancelled tasks; use `gsd_task_reopen` before replanning terminal work.

Planning and replanning never physically delete adopted work. Tasks removed by `gsd_plan_slice` or `gsd_replan_slice`, and slices removed by `gsd_reassess_roadmap`, are retained as cancelled history and omitted from active plan/roadmap projections. Reusing one of those IDs requires the corresponding `gsd_task_reopen` or `gsd_slice_reopen` call first.

`gsd_plan_milestone` cannot remove an existing slice. Use `gsd_reassess_roadmap` for an intentional pending-slice removal; completed slices remain protected.

`gsd_rework_brief_save` persists structured rework findings for a task. `projectDir` is optional; required parameters are `milestoneId`, `sliceId`, `taskId`, and a non-empty `findings` array. Each finding requires `findingId`, `severity` (`blocking` or `advisory`), `description`, `requiredFix`, and `verificationCommands`; optional fields are `status`, `evidence`, and `decisionRef`.

Blocking findings saved by `gsd_rework_brief_save` gate `gsd_task_complete`. To complete the task, the `gsd_task_complete` call must include a `reworkResolution` entry for each pending blocking `findingId` with `status: "resolved"` and non-empty `evidence`. Deferred findings must use `status: "deferred-with-override"` with non-empty `evidence` and a `decisionRef`.

For canonical auto-mode task execution, `gsd_task_complete` stages the executor result for the running Attempt instead of publishing task completion immediately. A successful call returns `details.attemptId`, `details.resultId`, `details.summaryPath`, and `details.nextStage`; `nextStage: "verify"` means the host must still run technical verification before completion is published, while `nextStage: "route"` means the executor reported a blocker or failed result that should be routed for recovery. After host verification records a passing Technical Verdict for the same source revision, auto mode publishes the task completion and refreshes the summary and plan projections. MCP clients should call this tool only for the active task Attempt they are executing; calls without a running or replay-matched canonical Attempt fail instead of falling back to legacy completion.

### Interactive tools

The packaged server exposes `ask_user_questions` through MCP form elicitation. This keeps the existing GSD answer payload shape while allowing Claude Code CLI and other elicitation-capable clients to surface structured user choices.

The packaged server also exposes `secure_env_collect` through MCP form elicitation. Secret values are written directly to the selected destination and are not included in tool output. For dotenv writes, `envFilePath` must resolve inside the validated project directory; parent traversal and symlink escapes are rejected.

`secure_env_collect` refuses to set variables that control the MCP server runtime itself, including `GSD_WORKFLOW_EXECUTORS_MODULE`, `GSD_WORKFLOW_WRITE_GATE_MODULE`, `GSD_WORKFLOW_PROJECT_ROOT`, `GSD_CLI_PATH`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, `NODE_PATH`, `PATH`, `LD_PRELOAD`, and `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`. These values must be configured by the operator in the MCP server environment, not collected from an MCP tool call.

Secret handling differs by destination:

- `dotenv`: accepted values are written to the project env file and hydrated into the current MCP server process so the active session can use them.
- `vercel` and `convex`: accepted values are pushed to the remote destination but are not added to `process.env`; restart or configure the consuming runtime normally if the current process needs that value.

Current support boundary:

- when running inside the GSD monorepo checkout, the MCP server auto-discovers the shared workflow executor module
- outside the monorepo, set `GSD_WORKFLOW_EXECUTORS_MODULE` to an importable `workflow-tool-executors` module path if you want the mutation tools enabled
- `ask_user_questions` and `secure_env_collect` require an MCP client that supports form elicitation
- session/read tool implementations do not use this bridge, but the packaged CLI still warms it at startup so Claude Code never sees a partial workflow surface

If the executor bridge cannot be loaded, the packaged CLI fails startup with a precise configuration error instead of silently degrading.

Startup is fail-closed for the workflow bridge: `gsd-mcp-server` loads the workflow executor and write-gate bridge before it connects over stdio. If bridge warm-up fails, the MCP host sees a startup failure instead of a partially advertised tool surface.

The server also keeps a per-project PID registry at `$GSD_HOME/mcp-instances.json` (default `~/.gsd/mcp-instances.json`). On startup it terminates a previously registered `gsd-mcp-server` process for the same project when the saved PID still belongs to an MCP server, then records the current PID. On normal shutdown it removes only its own entry. Corrupt registry files are preserved as `.corrupt-<timestamp>` backups before a new registry is written.

For stdio hosts that leave child processes behind, the server watches stdin activity. If stdin is idle for five minutes and the original parent process is gone, it cleans up sessions, unregisters its PID, and exits.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GSD_CLI_PATH` | Absolute path to the GSD CLI binary. If not set, the server resolves `gsd` via `which`. |
| `GSD_WORKFLOW_EXECUTORS_MODULE` | Optional absolute path or `file:` URL for the shared GSD workflow executor module used by workflow mutation tools. |
| `GSD_WORKFLOW_WRITE_GATE_MODULE` | Optional absolute path or `file:` URL for the shared write-gate module used by workflow mutation tools. |
| `GSD_WORKFLOW_PROJECT_ROOT` | Canonical project root for workflow tools and the per-project MCP PID registry key. Defaults to the server's current working directory. |
| `GSD_MCP_ADVERTISE_ALIASES` | Set to literal `1` to include legacy workflow aliases in the packaged MCP server's `tools/list`. Unset by default, so the server advertises canonical tool names only. |
| `GSD_MCP_HIDE_ALIASES` | Legacy force-hide switch. Set to literal `1` to keep packaged MCP aliases hidden even when `GSD_MCP_ADVERTISE_ALIASES=1`. |
| `GSD_ADVERTISE_TOOL_ALIASES` | Set to literal `1` to register legacy workflow aliases on the native in-process GSD tool surface. This does not affect the packaged MCP server; use `GSD_MCP_ADVERTISE_ALIASES` for `gsd-mcp-server`. |
| `GSD_HOME` | Global GSD directory. Also controls where `mcp-instances.json` is stored. |

The server also hydrates supported model-provider and tool credentials from `~/.gsd/agent/auth.json` on startup. Keys saved through `/gsd config` or `/gsd keys` become available to the MCP server process automatically, and any explicitly-set environment variable still wins.

Remote secrets pushed by `secure_env_collect` to Vercel or Convex are not hydrated into the MCP server process after the push. Use explicit MCP `env` configuration or a process restart when an operator-level value must be visible to the running server.

- **@opengsd/mcp-server** — MCP protocol adapter. Translates MCP tool calls into SessionManager operations.
- **SessionManager** — Manages RpcClient lifecycle. One session per project directory. Tracks events in a ring buffer (last 50), detects blockers, accumulates cost.
- **@opengsd/rpc-client** — Low-level RPC client that spawns and communicates with the GSD CLI process via JSON-RPC over stdio.
