# Architecture Overview

GSD is a TypeScript application built on the [Pi SDK](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). It embeds the Pi coding agent and extends it with the GSD workflow engine, auto mode state machine, and project management primitives.

## Key Design Decisions

### DB-Authoritative Project State

GSD stores runtime workflow state in the project-root SQLite database. Auto mode derives phases, completion status, requirements, decisions, summaries, and hierarchy from that database, then renders markdown projections in `.gsd/` for human review, prompt context, and git-friendly history. No in-memory state survives across sessions. This enables crash recovery, multi-terminal steering, and session resumption while avoiding silent markdown re-imports during normal runtime.

Milestone queue position has one explicit file contract: `.gsd/QUEUE-ORDER.json`. `/gsd rethink` and `/gsd phase` use it as a durable reorder record, and state derivation mirrors that order into `milestones.sequence` before selecting the active milestone. Other generated `.gsd` artifacts remain projections unless an explicit import or recovery command reads them.

`db/domain-operation.ts` is the authoritative write seam for milestone, slice, and task planning, task and slice replanning, roadmap reassessment, task execution Attempts, Task recovery routing, host Technical Verdicts, verified Task publication, and Slice complete/cancel/reopen/reset. `executeDomainOperation()` owns a `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction that revision- and Authority-Epoch-checks a request, reserves a project-scoped idempotency key, records provenance and ordered events, enqueues their outbox destinations and Projection Work, then advances authority with a compare-and-swap. Exact retries return the durable receipt without rerunning the mutation. `planning-domain-operation.ts` and `slice-lifecycle-domain-operation.ts` compose those guarantees with legacy hierarchy writes and lifecycle shadow comparison; `planning-invocation.ts` and `execution-invocation.ts` supply transport-stable private identity for Pi, internal auto-mode, and workflow MCP calls. Planning adopts canonical lifecycle heads while preserving the legacy public response contract, and removed pending work is retained as legacy `skipped` / canonical `cancelled` until explicitly reopened. Cleanup removes a stale PLAN file only when its current content still matches the writer-owned compatibility marker or PLAN artifact, preserving user-modified files. Execute-task units claim a canonical Attempt, settle exactly one immutable Result, route failures through bounded immutable Recovery Actions, record host verification evidence before publication, and publish completion only after a passing Technical Verdict for the current source revision. Slice operations validate the entire descendant hierarchy and commit one atomic cascade without erasing immutable execution history. Compatibility JSONL and Markdown are emitted after commit and cannot authorize lifecycle transitions; public callers preserve stale and duplicate projection diagnostics so a missing readable artifact cannot masquerade as a failed or fresh mutation. A resolved or dismissed user/external Blocker can continue only by being superseded by an agent-owned recovery route and a fresh lineage-linked Attempt. Milestone lifecycle commands, standalone UAT authority, and broader lifecycle routing have not fully cut over yet; the current schema version is owned by `SCHEMA_VERSION` in `db/engine.ts`, and Markdown remains projection output rather than workflow authority.

Historical Slice lifecycle replays additionally surface `superseded` with
`duplicate`; they never use current-success wording or repair a newer
projection.

### Semantic Shadow Evidence and Cutover Boundary

Milestone status remains a legacy-response read during M003. The shared status
executor reads legacy hierarchy and canonical lifecycle state in one read
transaction, compares them with the frozen lifecycle vocabulary, and emits a
response-neutral observation after the read. Native Pi captures the exact
project source revision lazily on the first status call in a turn and reuses it
for later status calls in that turn. The Claude workflow-MCP pump carries a
private token, captures the source revision lazily on its first status call,
and reuses that revision for later status calls in the pump. Capture or sink
failure never changes the public response, but it produces explicit, durable
loss accounting. No public tool argument or environment-provided hash can
supply source authority.

The S07 cutover dossier is a deterministic projection over two intentionally
different inputs: disposable `capstone_fixture` coverage and read-only
`live_project` database history. Random fixture identifiers are discarded when
the collector emits its normalized UAT artifact and appear only as stable
presence facts in the checked report. Exact live-project lifecycle identifiers
remain in the canonical-history plane. The report includes exact
mode/transport/classification counts, public-response and
capstone hashes, scoped repair lineage, live drift, compatibility witnesses,
the no-cutover gate, and the 4/4 authority baseline. It cannot authorize a
transition, repair state, or turn fixture coverage into production telemetry.

Candidate evidence names the exact source tree exercised before the generated
JSON exists. Post-generation checks and `verify:merge` are persisted through
database-backed UAT. The final source-bound Technical Verdict is created only
after rerunning the capstone from the exact merged commit; that database receipt
binds the merge commit, source-content revision, dossier hash, capstone hash,
and durable evidence. This two-phase protocol avoids a self-referential source
hash. S07 therefore proves convergence while remaining `NO_GO` for canonical
read authority until the explicitly deferred compatibility and lifecycle
surfaces are implemented and separately approved.

### Two-File Loader Pattern

`loader.ts` sets all environment variables with zero SDK imports, then dynamically imports `cli.ts` which does static SDK imports. This ensures `PI_PACKAGE_DIR` is set before any SDK code evaluates.

### `pkg/` Shim Directory

`PI_PACKAGE_DIR` points to `pkg/` (not project root) to avoid Pi's theme resolution colliding with GSD's `src/` directory. Contains only `piConfig` and theme assets.

### Managed Resource Sync

Bundled extensions, shared files, agents, and skills are synced to
`~/.gsd/agent/` on launch when the managed-resource manifest or content
fingerprint is stale. The `gsd-browser` skill is then overlaid from the
installed `@opengsd/gsd-browser` package, including package-relative support
files, so browser automation guidance tracks the browser package instead of a
duplicated Pi copy.

### Lazy Provider Loading

LLM provider SDKs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.) are lazy-loaded on first use rather than imported at startup. This significantly reduces cold-start time — only the provider you actually connect to gets loaded.

### Fresh Session Per Unit

Every dispatch creates a new agent session. The LLM starts with a clean context window containing only the pre-inlined artifacts it needs. This prevents quality degradation from context accumulation.

### Workspace Roots, Not Ambient `cwd`

GSD workflow code must treat the active project/worktree as explicit state, not infer it from ambient `process.cwd()`. Prefer `AutoSession.scope`, `s.canonicalProjectRoot`, `s.basePath`, `s.originalBasePath`, hook `ctx.cwd`, or an explicit `basePath` parameter depending on the boundary. `cwd` remains valid as a subprocess/shell option in generic Pi tooling, but GSD identity, DB paths, workflow gates, auto-mode sessions, and dynamic tool execution should be rooted from explicit workflow state.

- **text** — ANSI-aware text measurement and wrapping
- **html** — HTML-to-Markdown conversion
- **image** — decode, encode, resize images
- **fd** — fuzzy file path discovery
- **clipboard** — native clipboard access
- **git** — libgit2-backed git read operations
- **parser** — GSD file parsing and frontmatter extraction

## Dispatch Pipeline

The auto-loop is a **linear** pipeline (`auto/loop.ts`), the replacement for the older recursive `dispatchNextUnit → resolveAgentEnd → dispatchNextUnit` chain. Each iteration flows through explicit stages (see [auto-mode.md](../user-docs/auto-mode.md) for the full description):

```
1. Pre-Dispatch  — derive state, run UOK guards, resolve model preferences, check captures
2. Dispatch      — build the prompt and execute the unit with the selected model
3. Post-Unit     — close out the unit, snapshot metrics, verify artifacts, persist state
4. Finalize      — milestone/slice completion and projection
5. Loop          — advance to the next unit
```

Model routing (complexity classification, budget pressure, routing history, capability scoring) is folded into the Pre-Dispatch stage via `auto-model-selection.ts` (`selectAndApplyModel`), not handled as standalone pipeline steps. Phase skipping (from a token profile) gates which unit types are dispatched.

## Key Modules

> The auto-mode kernel lives under the `auto/` subdirectory (`auto/orchestrator.ts`, `auto/loop.ts`, `auto/phases.ts`, `auto/pre-dispatch.ts`, `auto/dispatch.ts`, `auto/finalize.ts`, `auto/detect-stuck.ts`, `auto/dispatch-key.ts`, `auto/dispatch-history.ts`, and `workflow-kernel.ts`). Pre-dispatch invariants are enforced by the `uok/` deep module (`uok/flags.ts`, `uok/gate-runner.ts`) wired into the orchestrator. The flat `auto-*.ts` modules below are the older, surrounding surface.
