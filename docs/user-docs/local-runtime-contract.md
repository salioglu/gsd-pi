# Project-local runtime contract

GSD discovers an optional project-local contract that tells agents how to start, inspect, seed, and stop a business project's local runtime. This avoids guessed ports, working directories, environment files, and direct package or container commands in repositories with custom startup choreography.

## Default convention

Create `script/local-runtime/` at the project root. GSD recognizes these files:

- `AGENT.md` — rules agents must follow before changing runtime state.
- `README.md` — human-readable startup, health, seed, and teardown instructions.
- `runtime.mjs`, `runtime.js`, `runtime.ts`, or `runtime.sh` — the canonical entry point, discovered in that order.

When any recognized file exists, GSD safely opens and injects bounded snapshots of `AGENT.md` and `README.md`, plus validated entry-point metadata, into agent and subagent system context. GSD does not automatically execute the entry point or infer its actions.

```text
script/
└── local-runtime/
    ├── AGENT.md
    ├── README.md
    └── runtime.mjs
```

Document the actions supported by the entry point in `README.md`, for example:

```text
node script/local-runtime/runtime.mjs start
node script/local-runtime/runtime.mjs status
node script/local-runtime/runtime.mjs seed
node script/local-runtime/runtime.mjs stop
```

## Custom location

Set `runtime.contract` in project-local `.gsd/PREFERENCES.md` to nominate a different directory or entry point:

```yaml
---
runtime:
  contract:
    path: ops/dev
    entry: run.mjs
---
```

Global preferences do not activate or override a runtime contract; each project must opt in locally when it does not use the default path.

Both values must be relative paths that remain inside the project. Recognized contract members must be real regular files; symlinks are rejected even when their targets remain inside the contract directory.

If a configured or discovered contract cannot be validated or safely snapshotted, GSD injects a blocking diagnostic instead of contract content. Agents must not start, restart, seed, stop, reset, or tear down the runtime until the contract is repaired. A project with no configured contract and no recognized files remains behavior-neutral.

In a parent workspace, place the shared contract at the parent project root. Child-repository startup can then be coordinated through one documented entry point.
