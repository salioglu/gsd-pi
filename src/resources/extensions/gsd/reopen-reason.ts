// Project/App: gsd-pi
// File Purpose: Persist a reopened task's failure diagnosis and inject it into the re-dispatched execute-task prompt.
// GSD Extension — follow-up to #1225 (#1272)
//
// When complete-slice's gate reopens a task via gsd_task_reopen, the operator
// supplies a `reason` explaining exactly what the full-suite gate caught and
// how to fix it. That reason previously only landed in the workflow event log
// (audit trail) and never reached the re-dispatched executor, so the executor
// re-ran the original (green) verify and re-completed the task without touching
// the regression. This module is the "inject unresolved context into the next
// dispatch" mechanism for reopen reasons — a lightweight, file-based sibling of
// escalation.js#claimOverrideForInjection, keyed by (milestone, slice, task).
